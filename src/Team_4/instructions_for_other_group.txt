1) put "MBZIRC_field" and "my_robot" folders in “home/.gazebo/models/”
**NOTE: to show hidden files (like .gazebo) in home press ctrl+h with home open in the file viewer

2) open a terminal and input the following commands:
cd ~/.gazebo/models/my_robot/build
cmake ../
make

3) put our world file somewhere on your computer

4) in new terminal window, do these comands:
source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash
export GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH=$HOME/.gazebo/models/my_robot/build:$GAZEBO_PLUGIN_PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$HOME/.gazebo/models/my_robot/build:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

5) in the same terminal as step 4, path to the folder that you put our world file in and do this command:
gazebo my_world.world
